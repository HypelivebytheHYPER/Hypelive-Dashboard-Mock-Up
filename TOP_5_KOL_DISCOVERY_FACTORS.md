## 🎯 The Top 5 Essential Factors

### 1. **Audience Relevance & Demographics** (67% say this is #1)
**Why It Matters:**
- 67% of marketers believe **relevancy is the most important factor** in choosing KOLs
- Your target customer and the influencer's audience should overlap significantly

**What to Check:**

- ✅ Audience gender distribution (Male/Female/Other %)
- ✅ Audience location (Bangkok, Thailand vs international)
- ✅ Audience interests and behaviors
- ✅ Language spoken by followers

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ If you're targeting Thai customers but 60% of followers are international

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found in Our Dashboard

### Issue #1: Engagement Rate Values Are Wrong
**Current Data:**
- HYPKOL00120250914: Engagement Rate = 10860.08%
- HYPKOL00220250914: Engagement Rate = 2660.52%
- HYPKOL00320250914: Engagement Rate = 4985.34%

**Problem:** These values are impossible. Normal engagement rates are 1-10%.

**Likely Cause:**
- Database storing raw engagement numbers instead of percentages
- OR engagement = total engagements (likes + comments), not rate

**Fix Needed:**
```typescript
// Current (WRONG):
engagementRate: parseNumber(fields["Engagement Rate"])

// Should be (check what the actual value represents):
engagementRate: parseNumber(fields["Engagement Rate"]) / 100 // if stored as basis points
// OR
engagementRate: (totalEngagements / (follower * posts)) * 100 // if needs calculation
```

### Issue #2: Missing Critical Vetting Data
**What Brands Need:**
- ✅ Follower authenticity score (% real followers)
- ✅ Growth chart (detect fake follower spikes)
- ✅ Bot detection score
- ✅ Comment quality analysis
- ✅ Audience demographics per KOL

**Currently:** We only have overall demographics, not per-KOL
