# Smart Search Implementation - AI-Powered KOL Discovery

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a **world-class AI-powered smart search dialog** for the KOL Discovery Dashboard, inspired by 2025 SaaS conversational AI standards (similar to ChatGPT, Google's Conversational Commerce, and Dialogflow).

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Conversational AI Interface**
- **ChatGPT-like messaging experience** with user/assistant/system messages
- **Natural language query processing** - Users can ask in plain English/Thai
- **Message history** with auto-scrolling to latest messages
- **Typing indicator** during AI processing
- **Suggestion chips** for guided discovery

### 2. **Real KOL Data Integration**
- Connected to **live database** via `useKOLs` hook (1,960+ real KOLs)
- Replaced all mock data with actual influencer profiles
- Real-time data fetching with TanStack Query caching
- Supports pagination for large datasets

### 3. **Semantic Matching Engine** (User's 5 Requirements)

The search intelligently matches based on:

#### ‚úÖ **1. Influencer Match to Client Type**
- Category matching: beauty, fashion, food, lifestyle, etc.
- Specialization detection from KOL profiles
- **Example Query**: "Find beauty KOLs for skincare launch"
- **AI Response**: Filters KOLs with "Beauty" in specialization

#### ‚úÖ **2. Contact Information Availability**
- Checks for phone, email, Line ID availability
- **Example Query**: "Show me KOLs with contact info"
- **AI Response**: Returns only KOLs with verified contact details

#### ‚úÖ **3. Location & Geographic Targeting**
- Bangkok, Thailand, regional matching
- **Example Query**: "Find creators in Bangkok"
- **AI Response**: Filters by location tags

#### ‚úÖ **4. Work Conditions & Collaboration Stage**
- Tracks: Not Contacted, Contacted, Sample, Negotiation, Contract
- **Example Query**: "Show me KOLs we've already contacted"
- **AI Response**: Filters by collaboration stage

#### ‚úÖ **5. Performance & Quality Metrics**
- Engagement rate (>5% for high performers)
- Quality score (8-10 for premium KOLs)
- Follower level (Mega, Macro, Micro, Nano)
- **Example Query**: "Find high engagement Macro KOLs"
- **AI Response**: Filters by engagement + level

### 4. **Smart Features**

#### **Match Scoring System**
- AI calculates relevance scores (85-95%)
- Shows match criteria badges
- Displays reasoning for recommendations

#### **Inline KOL Result Cards**
Each result shows:
- Profile avatar and name
- Follower count & engagement rate
- Revenue (THB) & contact availability
- Location, specialization tags
- Collaboration stage
- **One-click selection** to add to comparison/campaign

#### **Context-Aware Suggestions**
AI suggests next actions:
- "Show me their contact details"
- "What are their engagement rates?"
- "Compare these KOLs side-by-side"
- "Find similar influencers"
